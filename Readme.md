# The CTF Book

If you wanna learn some hacking and you prefer reading over watching videos, then this is the book
for you! Each section will introduce you to a different area of hacking. And at the end of each
chapter you will be provided with some challenges to help you test out your new found skills
hands-on!

*Disclaimer: this book is still very much a work in progress*
