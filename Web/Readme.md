# Web

This series of lessons will introduce you to the basics of web hacking. Each lesson has associated
challenges which allow you to apply the skills you learn. Due to the fact that many challenges need
to hide their source code, challenges may have a directory called `Hidden` that you are not allowed
to look inside until you have solved the challenge.

## Prerequisites

- A computer with `python3` installed
