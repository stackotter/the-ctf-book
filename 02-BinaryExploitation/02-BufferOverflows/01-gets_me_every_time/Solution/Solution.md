Run `exploit.py` to see the exploit in action.

From reading the code, we can see that the buffer for user input has a length of 32. However, the
`gets` function that is used to read user input does not take any length argument, and will just
keep reading the user's input into the buffer until the user presses the enter key.

The value directly after the user input buffer is called the saved `rbp` value. It is the value that
the `rbp` register contained before the current function was called. After the saved `rbp` is the
saved `rip`. This value is a pointer to the assembly instruction to execute once the current
function `return`s. If we overwrite this value, we can control what happens once `main` finishes
execution.

The exploit writes 32 `a`s to fill up the buffer, then it writes 8 more `a`s to get to the saved
`rip` value, and finally it writes the address of the first instruction in the `win` function
which it uses pwntools to extract. Once line 14 is reached, `main` will return execution to the
saved `rip` value, and `win` will run - giving us the flag.
