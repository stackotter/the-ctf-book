We can just stop execution halfway through `main` function and change `can_win` (`rbp-0x4`) from `0`
to `1` and then continue execution.

```console
$ gdb ./debug_me
gdb) b *main+15
Breakpoint 1 at 0x401141
gdb) run
Starting program: ./debug_me
Breakpoint 1, 0x0000000000401141 in main ()
gdb) set {int}($rbp-4) = 1
gdb) c
Continuing.
There's no way you can win
