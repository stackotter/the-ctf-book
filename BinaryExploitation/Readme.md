# Binary Exploitation

This series of lessons will introduce you to a variety of binary exploitation concepts and
techniques. Each lesson is accompanied by one or more challenges.

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming skills
- A Linux computer, virtual machine or container with `python3`, `gdb` and `python3-pip` installed
  - If you don't have any sort of Linux machine/vm set up, the tutorial at `../SettingUpDocker.md`
    is a good starting place

## Lessons

- **The basics**: An introduction to CPUs, RAM, assembly code, machine code and executable files
  - **safe**: A binary exploitation challenge
- **Buffer overflows**: An introduction to CPU registers, the stack, the heap and buffer overflows
  - **gets_me_every_time**: A straight forward buffer overflow challenge
  - **like_an_onion**: A slightly more involved buffer overflow challenge to test critical thinking
- **The debugger**: An introduction to the handy `gdb` debugger
  - **debug_me**: A simple challenge that requires the use of a debugger
  - **out_of_bbq**: A similar challenge to `gets_me_every_time`, except this time no source code is
    provided
- **Ghidra**: An introduction to the free `Ghidra` decompiler (made by the NSA :O)
  - **volatile_passcode**: An introductory reverse engineering challenge
