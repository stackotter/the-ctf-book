The easiest way to solve this challenge is to use the `strings` command (on Linux and macOS).

```console
$ strings ./safe
...
Enter the password:
s3cr37_pa5sw0rd
Better luck next time
...
```

Just run the command and scroll through the output until you find something that looks like a
password (`s3cr37_pa5sw0rd` in this case).

This works because the program has the password hardcoded, and therefore the string is stored in the
executable file as ASCII text. The `strings` command will look through the file and extract anything
that looks like readable text. An alternative method is to just open the executable file in a text
editor, but you'll have to manually search through all of the unreadable weird looking bytes to find
the password.

The source code for the challenge is in `src.c`.

## Bonus

A solution for the bonus challenge can be found in `exploit.py`

## Ghidra

Ghidra is a bit overkill for this challenge, but if you want to learn how to use Ghidra, this is a
nice and simple challenge to try it out on. Ghidra should be able to reverse engineer the executable
file and figure out what the original c code might have looked like. It should spit out some code
that looks similar to `src.c`.
